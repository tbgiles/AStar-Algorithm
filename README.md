## Useful for all you mazers with little to no time available to solve your mazes!
## (Written with ❤️ and Python)

To run:
  1. Create your program, and import this file as AStar
  2. In your program, create an object of this class, and make sure you have a 2x2 matrix (2x2 list) represented as boolean 1's and 0's for places you can and can't go respectively
  3. On your object, call the 'computePath' method with the parameter as the tuple representing your desired destination
  4. Boom! Solved, with a built in timer too!
